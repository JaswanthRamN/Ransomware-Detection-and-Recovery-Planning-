# 🛡️ Ransomware Detection and Recovery Planning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project applies **machine learning and data mining** techniques to detect ransomware threats with **92% accuracy**. Using a **public dataset (~62,000 instances, 18 attributes)**, we classify **malware vs. benign files**, enhancing cybersecurity.  

## 📂 Methodology  
1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Feature Selection** – Removed inconsistencies, selected key features.  
2️⃣ **Data Exploration & Splitting** – Analyzed distributions, split into **80% training, 20% testing**.  
3️⃣ **Model Training & Evaluation** – Implemented **Random Forest (best at 92%)**, SVM, and other models.  

## 📊 Results  
- **92% detection accuracy** with **Random Forest**.  
- Identified key ransomware characteristics (**file size, DLL imports**).  
- Improved understanding of **malware behavior**.  

## 🔮 Future Work  
- **Advanced ML techniques** for deeper insights.  
- **Deep learning models** for enhanced detection.  
- **Testing with real-world ransomware data**.
